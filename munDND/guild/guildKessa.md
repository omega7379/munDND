[[World]] 

A guild designed for information and rescue missions. Someone gone missing? Pay the guild and you'll have results guaranteed! Need info on someone? The more you pay, the more you get!

The Guild has outposts all over the continent of Faerun. Full-service guild locations featuring both public and private operations exist in the capital cities of each country. Smaller cities and towns have varying levels of accomodation from simple outpost with 2-3 agents to full size tavern with several adventuring parties.

The main method of sending messages is through the use of [[scoxes]] however due to some limitations such as crossing the sea, carrier ravens and human means are also used.

The public eye of the guild is all about helping people. However they also have an underground, this is where operatives can be hired for dirty work, or getting hands on outlawed knowledge.

The guild has 2 main sections:

### The Brass
The brass is comprised of directors, lawyers, assistants, researchers...etc. If you have anything to do with policies, it's here.

### The Operators
Operators are people who do the field work of the guild.

- Fighters, paladins, monks are the public figurehead of the group, if a commission requires a lot of muscles or as a PR stunt. This section of teams lead by Director [[TheronStrongbow]] * handles it

- Rogues, Rangers, and Druids tend to be more in the background of such grandeur. They are the ones who sneak around or do the true heavy lifting in SAR commisions and gathering time-sensitive information. These people operate under Director [[LaisenFairview]]'s* commands.

- Overly charasmatic people, usually warlocks and sorcerers, are the distractors. Using their higher-than-average ability to pull info out of someone without a target noticing is the ideal way of getting info out of someone. This is what [[KaisenLongheart]] does in casinos, bars, plazas..etc. They also double as being the distraction in hairy situations to give their rogue friends some more time. After all what's more distracting than wild magic. They operate with orders from Director [[SensaMirach]] *

*Note: Names are subject to change based on the country, these are the names of the people Kaisen reports to on his current deployment*
