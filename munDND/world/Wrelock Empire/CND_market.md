## Campaign

### session 0

After leaving the arena:
- `Jazzer` and `A1-13` still treat `Kaisen` as a prisoner as they head outside into `Nobility District- market`. 
- `Jazzer` goes off to a potions stall, nearby patrons are trying to haggle the price of 10gp for a common hp potion. `A1-13` and `Kaisen` go in a different direction. 
- `A1-13` approaches a fortune-teller and gets denied. `Kaisen` listens in on passerby, hears murmurs "Did you see? The Queen appeared and stumbled. There's no way she's the [[Ink-knight]] has to be a fake." 
- Eventually everyone meets up and `Jazzer` gets a fortune told. 
- Taking advantage of the distracted guards, `Kaisen` says "you know where I'll be" and tries to dart off. The other 2 cut their convos short and follow. 
- `Kaisen` asks to be stopped being treated like a prisoner, as far as they're concerned, we're stuck in the same boat. `A1-13` says no, `Jazzer` sorta agrees.
- They go to [[guildKessa]]
