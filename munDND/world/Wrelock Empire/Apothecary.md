## Campaign

### Session 0

- In the apothecary, `Jazzer` inquires about flowers and studies the assortment of medicinal plants. Serril doesn't typically grow plants that aren't useful. 
- Small pixies and sprites flit around the bushes and vines maintaining the garden. 
- `A1-13` comes in and inquires about medicines for non-bio lifeforms. While `Ferril` checks, `Jazzer` tries to sneak into the backroom, the entrance covered in vines. 
- `Jazzer` gets electrocuted and falls to the ground. It's revealed that the backrooms have patients that need privacy and private living quarters. 
- None of the patients are affected by abnormal or necrotic effects. 1 patient has early stage vampirism and is recovering well. 
- `Kaisen` buys a common potion, then the party heads out towards the [[City Commoners District]]
