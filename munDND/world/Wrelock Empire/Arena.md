## Campaign

### session 0

-  A warforged named `A1-13` and a drow named `Jazzer` stand as guards on either side of the Announcer box at the `Arena` in town. 
- `Kaisen` stands in the crowds near `A1-13` watching the show. 
- A bunch of prisoners are released into the arena field followed by a creature which kills all but 1 person before disappearing. 
- A knight in full plate armour walks out from the tunnel, halfway to the prisoner, she trips and falls to her face, identity to be revealed as  [[Queen Tixianna]]. 
- Someone in the crowd chuckles then guards spring into action arresting people including `Kaisen`. The Queen gets up, draws her sword and kills the prisoner before sending a glare at the crowd.
- `Kaisen` tries to use "Fast Friends" on `A1-13` (successfully) to try and get away but a fellow guard puts an end to the escape plan. 
- `Jazzer` locates and arrests the person that laughed earlier. All of the arrested are lined up in the Announcer Box, `Tixianna` comes up a moment later and asks what people saw. `Kaisen` tries to (unsuccessfully) bluff his way out of it with "I didn't see much". `Jazzer` says they arrested the person that laughed _points the person out_. `A1-13` exactly what happened down to the finest detail much to `Tixianna's` satisfaction. 
- She turns and mutters words in elvish to royal advisors. `Kaisen` picks up some sentences, "Time to poison the water supply". She turns back and asks in common, "which ones of you are good at investigation?". 
- `Kaisen, Jazzer, A1-13` indicate that they are. `Kaisen` being a PI from `Guild Kessa` and the other 2 being royal guards.
- "This is a task with utmost confidentiality" 
1. the city's military power runs off of a power-source deep below the city 
2. something is draining its power, rn it's taking a lot just to maintain the current level 
3. this needs to be done ASAP, at most we have 1 year, ideally solve it within a couple months 
4. tampering suspected to be by mortal means not divine 
5. currently can't access the source, the creatures protecting it would wipe out the party

- After being dismissed the party goes to the Arena field, `Kaisen` checks the spot where `Tixianna` fell down, finds traces of necrotic energy, tastes like a whiskey sour
