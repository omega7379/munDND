## Backstory
As an info-broker, Kaisen is tasked with the arduios duty of collecting and selling high valued information. A task he's been good at for the last 13 years. Kaisen rarely leaves the city unless on assignment from the guild, preferring that his adventuring compatriots deal with the dangers of the wild. Sometimes though getting not just info but the _right_ info requires being a little more hands-on and bloody work. His relationship with the small team of rogue's he usually work with is on good terms, however his tactics in diplomacy and trickery leave a sour taste in other strike teams.

Regarding family ties... His father works as a blacksmith for the Guild and mother is KIA. His sister went missing 6 years ago and is the pinnacle of why Kaisen has put up with the Guild Leader's bullshit for this long. Afterall what's the best way to look for someone than to be paid while doing it. Of course, being MIA for 6 years makes it a cold case but it's one file he makes sure doesn't get thrown away or burned.
